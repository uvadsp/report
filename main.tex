\section{Requirements}

These user requirements are derived from the case description provided by the client as well as feedback from the stakeholder during the initial ideation and prototyping phase of the project and where further narrowed down during the project design workshops using the MoSCoW priorization method. The term 'user' in the requirements refers to two specific types of similar target audiences that will make use of our prototype, police agents who want to explore the dataset to gain insights and data analysts who want to filter and compare our datasets.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item (M) The user must be able to use the prototype on a personal computer and interface with a screen
  \item (M) The user must be able to filter the datasets to compare different years of data
  \item (M) The user must be able to filter the datasets to compare different types of drugs
  \item (M) The user must be able to overlay multiple datasets and trend lines on top of eachother
  \item (M) The system uses open-source software and not locked-in corporate data tools
  \item (M) The system has a user-friendly visual design and interaction design
  \item (S) The user should create an account to store specific and personalized filters
  \item (S) The user should be able to download the raw datasets in specific file formats
  \item (S) The user should be able to navigate between different overviews showing corresponding data
  \item (C) The user could upload their own dataset and sources of specfic drugs and news sources
  \item (C) The system uses real-time up-to-date API data
\end{enumerate}
