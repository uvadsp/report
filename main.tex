\section{Introduction}
For the police, it is important to monitor the modus operandi of criminal organizations. By analyzing the modus operandi, the police can gain insight into the plans of the criminal organizations in order to intercept them. Indeed, the modus operandi describes the entire way criminal organizations operate, from the beginning of the production stage to the use of its consumer. 

This report examines a particular stage of the modus operandi in general in The Netherlands and presents the results in a visual way so that the stakeholder, the Police Academy, can get an insight on this stage of the modus operandi. 
Various trends in the field of drugs in the Netherlands were researched. Using a google search trends analysis and an analysis to court cases in the Netherlands, an attempt was made to make connections between these two sources. These results are presented in a visual way that provides new insights for the Police Academy.
\subsection{Problem statement}

\section{Related work}
\subsection{Stakeholder research}
A study of the stakeholder with their values and what they would like to see as an outcome from us. 

The stakeholder is the Police Academy and the number one goal they want from us is to gain insight into the 'Modus operandi' of criminal organizations in the field of drugs. The values and norms of the Police Academy must be clear and the result must be designed accordingly. 

We can represent this well with a visual that states what the stakeholder's values and norms are, what they want to see as a result and what their focus points are. 

\subsection{Modus operandi}
Telling about modus operandi, what it entails and perhaps some research that is already done on 'modus operandi'. Telling about what stage of modus operandi we want to investigate and how that can contribute for the new insights of the Police Academy.

\subsection{Drugs}
What are drugs? Which drugs do we want to focus on? Why? 

\subsection{Drugs in the Netherlands}
When did some drugs become legal or illegal, when did a certain law come through that, for example, had a major impact on the use of (a certain) drug, etc.
Perhaps depict this in a timeline which shows the events of influence (and then describe it in the text).
